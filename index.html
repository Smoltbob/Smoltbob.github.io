To answer this, let's look at the evolution and the state of the pandemic in Canda, and relate it to demographics and geography.</p></section><section class="text-section waffle"><h1>State of the pandemic in Canada</h1><p>First we will take a look at a waffle chart.</p></section><section class="viz-section waffle"><div class="steps"><section><h1>Waffle 1</h1><p>This is the first step of waffle</p></section><section><h1>Waffle 2</h1><p>Second step of waffle</p></section><section><h1>Waffle 3</h1><p>Third step of waffle</p></section></div><div class="viz" id="waffle"></div></section><section class="text-section connected"><h1>Spread of the pandemic for the different provinces</h1><p>How did Covid-19 spread through Canada ?
