We propose a few visualizations that helps to understand how the virus spread through groups of specific age ranges and genders and how it moved through the country.</p></section><section class="viz-section w1"><div class="steps"><section><h1>Confirmed cases</h1><p>The ratio of Canadian infected people to the population of Canada</p></section></div><div class="viz" id="w1"></div></section><section class="viz-section w2"><div class="steps"><section><h1>Hospitalized cases</h1><p>The ratio of Canadian hospitalized people to the population of confirmed cases</p></section></div><div class="viz" id="w2"></div></section><section class="viz-section w3"><div class="steps"><section><h1>Dead cases</h1><p>The ratio of Canadian dead people to the population of confirmed cases</p></section></div><div class="viz" id="w3"></div></section><section class="text-section connected"><h1>Spread of the pandemic for the different provinces</h1><p>How did Covid-19 spread through Canada?
